                <img src="images/titleDescription.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback title and description">
            </p>

            <p>
                Every playback has a title and a description. This sets the context for the code that a viewer is about to see animated. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The author might provide some background on the problem that is being solved or give some hint about the techniques that will be shown in the playback.
            </p>
                 
            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> The description can be hidden by clicking on the name of the playback at the top of the screen with a dropdown arrow next to it.

            <h4>Playback Window</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="images/playbackWindow.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback window">
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the playback window. It has a tab for each file to be animated, some controls, and other information. A playback shows
                the evolution of some code with some comments about how and why the code is changing over time. A developer can create a playback
                with a series of comments that tells the story of how their code evolved.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h6>Playback Control</h6>
            <p>
                <img src="images/playbackControls.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback controls">
            </p>

            <p>
                To get a playback to start or stop there is a button to toggle between <code>Play</code> and <code>Pause</code>. 
                Playback 'events' are animated one at a time. There are different kinds of playback events. There are events for the insertion
                and deletion of individual text characters along with events to record file/directory operations (create, delete, move, rename). 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are buttons to move one event at a time (<code>&lt;</code> for backward and <code>&gt;</code> for forward) or to 
                move one comment at a time (<code>&lt;&lt;</code> to move to the previous comment and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to move forward 
                to the next comment).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are keyboard shortcuts to move through a playback as well. The <code>space bar</code> toggles between play and pause.
                <code>left arrow</code> and <code>right arrow</code> move the playback one event at a time. <code>shift + left arrow</code> 
                and <code>shift + right arrow</code> move the playback to the next comments.
            </p>

            <p>
                Filters limit what part of a development session gets played back. More information about filtering can be found <a href="filter.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> Although Storyteller is capable of animating the insertion and deletion of every single character in a programming session some 
                viewers prefer to skip the animation and focus on the state of the code at comments points only. Often, this allows a viewer to get through the playback faster. These controls 
                enable the flexibility to view the playback with animation or simply at the comment points.

            </p>

            <br/>
            <h6>Current Event Information</h6>
            <p>
                As the playback progresses events are handled in the playback window. The most current event has some information recorded about it.
                This information is described in the section labelled 'Event Info' in the user interface. It displays the event number, the event type, 
                the location of the event, and a timestamp of when the event was recorded.  
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h6>Developer Information</h6>
            <p>
                <img src="images/developer1.png" width="40%" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Developer">
                <img src="images/developer2.png" width="40%" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Developer with extra info">
            </p>
            <p>
                This part of the interface shows which developer was active when the event was recorded. Storyteller supports multiple
                developers programming together in groups. Each active developer will be shown here. More information about managing
                developers can be found <a href="devs.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Storyteller uses the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" class="strong-link" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service for developer images.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> Mousing over the developer image shows more information about the developer.

            <br/>
            <h4>Viewing Comments</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="images/playbackProgress.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback progress">
            </p>
            <p>
                The green playback progress bar shows roughly how many relevant events have been played and how many are left. The dark green vertical 
                bars are points in the playback where comments have been added. By default, a playback will pause when an event with a comment is encountered.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> The playback progress bar can also be used to jump to different points in the playback. Click anywhere in the bar and the
                viewer will be taken to that point.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="images/displayComment.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback comment">
            </p>

            <p>
                One the left hand side of the screen is the comment area. When making a playback authors can pause it at any point and add a comment. When the 
                playback is replayed the comment will show at the pause point. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When making the comment the author can choose to highlight some code and it will be associated with the comment. It shows up with a highlight 
                in the playback window and is used to direct a comment to a one or more portions of the code. The picture above shows a playback paused on a 
                comment. There is some highlighted code, <code>(new Thread ... )</code>, that the author is describing in the comment. More information about 
                making comments can be found <a href="playback.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                When moving from comment to comment new code will show up in blue. Previously displayed code will be changed to the color green. If there was some 
                deleted text a red bar will show up where the delete occurred. This makes it easy to see what has changed since the last comment. In addition, 
                for each file that has been updated since the last comment will get a marker * next to the name in the file tabs. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The author can create comments that include text, hand drawn pictures, screenshots, or video to help them describe what is happening in their code.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> Clicking on an image or a video will make it larger.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A single pause point can include more than one comment. Multiple comments are stacked on top of each other and some may not be visible 
                on the screen until the viewer scrolls down. To make it easier to notice that there are multiple comments there is a comment counter. 
                Each time a viewer clicks on a comment a running sum of 'read' comments will be increased. The viewer can use this to help them know 
                if they are ready to move on to the next comment.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h4>State of the File System</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="images/fileSystem.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback file system">
            </p>

            <p>
                As a playback progresses the viewer can see the state of the file system when each event was recorded. This is shown on the bottom left of the screen.
                Each time a file was added, removed, renamed, or moved in the author's programming session this view will be updated.
            </p>

            <p>
                A viewer can download the code at any point during a playback and experiment with it in the same state it is in the playback window. More information 
                about downloading code can be found <a href="download.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Storyteller is also a distributed version control system that supports simple branching and merging. More information about this feature can be found 
                <a href="versionControl.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.
