                There are some options that can be set by opening the Options modal with the link in the bottom right hand 
                corner of the playback window. These options and features control playback and saving and restoring playbacks.

            </p>

            <h4>Playback Control</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="images/options1.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Playback options">
            </p>
            <h6>Playback Speed</h6>
            <p>
                The animation speed of the playback can be set in 25 ms increments to make experiencing playbacks comfortable for the viewer. 
            </p>
            <h6>Pause for Comments</h6>
            <p>
                By default, an animated playback will pause on every comment. If the viewer would like view a playback without comments
                this option can be can be unchecked. 
            </p>
            <h6>Show All Cuts and Pastes in Blocks</h6>
            <p>
                If text was removed or inserted in a programming session with cut or paste it is possible to view those operations in a 
                single step. By default, this option is not selected and all cut and pastes will animate one character at a time.
            </p>
            <h6>Highlight Recent Changes</h6>
            <p>
                All new changes to a playback are displayed in blue (for inserts) and red (for deletes). It is possible to disable this option. 
                It is also possible to clear the recent changes when paused in a playback.
            </p>

            <h4>Saving and Replaying Playbacks</h4>
            <p>

            <h6>Download a Playback</h6>
            <p>
                The documentation in <a href="download.html" class="strong-link">Downloading the code in a playback</a> 
                describes how to download the code associated with a playback. The zip file that holds this code also has a directory 
                called <code>.storyteller</code> that contains the data required to playback the history of that code.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a viewer would just like to store the raw playback data (and not the code that goes with it) they can download a 
                single file called <code>playbackData.json</code> from any playback. This holds all of the information required to 
                generate a playback (which can then be used to download the source code). This file can be downloaded on this part 
                of the Options modal.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> When sharing code and playbacks this is a convenient format to send to
                others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> Saving <code>playbackData.json</code> in this way preserves the                 
                <a href="filter.html" class="strong-link">filters</a> that have been applied to the playback.   
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> An alternate way of saving a playback is to save the html file that 
                gets generated by Storyteller using the browser's 'Save' option. This is a very fast and convenient way of saving and 
                sharing a playback. One drawback is that if the playback is filtered the filters will not be present in the saved web page.
            </p>
            <h6>Upload a Playback</h6>
            <p>
                A <code>playbackData.json</code> file can be uploaded to play a stored playback. This will wipe out the current playback
                in the browser.

            <h6>Font size</h6>
            <p>
                The size of the text can be increased or decreased using the size option.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> There are convenient keyboard shortcuts for most of these options
                to make it easier to quickly navigate a playback.
