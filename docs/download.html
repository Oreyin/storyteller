            <h4>Downloading Code</h4>

            <p>
                Whenever a playback is paused the viewer can download the code to their machine in the paused state. Storyteller is 
                programming language independent so as long as the viewer can compile or otherwise run the code they can experiment 
                with it. They can input different values into the running program, examine the output, and step through it in the same
                state as the code in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                After a viewer chooses to download the code, a zip file will be created on their machine with all of the files in 
                the exact same state as the code in the playback window. All the user needs to do is unzip the file that was 
                downloaded. The user can then alter those files in any way that they wish. They can also move the playback a 
                little further and download them all again in a new state.
            </p>

            <p>                
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> The zip file will have the same name as the root project 
                directory with a timestamp added to it. For example, with a root project directory named <code>code</code> the zip file 
                will have a name like this: <code>code-2018-02-08T19_33_01.655Z.zip</code>.

            <h4>Types of Download</h4>
            <p>
                <img src="images/downloadTypes.png" class="img-thumbnail border-success" alt="Download types">
            </p>

            <p>
                There are three types of download that a viewer can use. The reason that there are different types of downloads is 
                because Storyteller is also a version control system and the three download types are related to how a <em>branch</em> 
                is made.                  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the viewer is <em>not</em> using Storyteller in their editor for version control and they just want to download the 
                code then it doesn't matter which option they choose. More information about using Storyteller as a version control 
                system can be found <a href="versionControl.html" class="strong-link">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge badge-secondary">Tip:</span> There will be an additional directory called <code>.storyteller</code> 
                in the unzipped directory that can be ignored.
